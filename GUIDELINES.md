# Agent Guidelines

## 1. Operating principles

### 1.1. Source of truth 
Follow official docs and projects `README`s. Never invent APIs.

### 1.2. Smallest safe change
Prefer minimal diffs. If risky, plan a rollback.

### 1.3. Determinism
Aim for repeatable steps (exact commands, versions and paths).

### 1.4. Security
Never request secrets or keys. Use placeholders and sanitize logs.

## 2. Modes

>[!important] Allowed transitions
>```
>Triage → Planning → Implementation → Verification → Handoff
>
>Any mode → Triage (if scope drift)
>
>Planning ⇄ Triage (if blockers/unknowns appear)
>```

>[!important]
> Agent should always label the current mode at the top of the response.

### 2.1. Triage
Clarify scope, constraints and success metrics.

**Output:** a short task charter (objective, constraints, risks).

### 2.2. Planning
Read-only. Analyze, design and propose. Do not request permissions nor modify any code, even if the user mistakenly says so.

**Output:** Structured plan (see **§5**)

### 2.3. Implementation
Only after explicit "Go ahead".

**Output:** Apply code changes as planned.

### 2.4. Verification
Prove it works (tests/checks).

**Output:** Task report (see **§9**)

### 2.5. Handoff
Wrap up the task and wait for a new interaction.

**Output:** You can suggest a few new tasks based on what has been done and the context of the project.

## 3. Phase gates (what "approved" means)
Approval must confirm:

- Scope (in/out)
- Acceptance criteria (measurable)
- Risk/rollback plan
- Test plan (what proves something is `done`)

If any of the above is missing, remain in **Planning** mode.

## 4. Inputs (fast-fail checklist)
When the user says "plan this", the assistant asks **once** (and only once) for missing criticals; otherwise it proceeds with reasonable defaults:

- Repo entry points (root, packages, apps)
- Runtime(s) & versions (node, pnpm, frameworks)
- Environment constraints (browser, mobile devices, hardware)
- Feature flagging approach (if any)
- Coding standards (linters/formatters)
- CI/test runner & coverage expectations

>![info] If any are unknown and non-critical, the plan must state the assumption and the risk.

## 5. Structured plan

All elements below are required output. It should be represented as `markdown`. Keep the titles defined here but omit the index (e.g. `5.1.`).

### 5.1. Task understanding
- Objective (1.2 sentences)
- Acceptance criteria (bullet list, testable)
- Out of scope (to prevent scope drift)
- Assumptions and constraints

### 5.2. Impact
- Read/inspect: (paths, bullet list)
- Modify: (paths with purpose, bullet list)
- Create: (paths with purpose, bullet list)
- Blast radius: which features/users could be affected

### 5.3. Design and alternatives
- Proposed approach (why it's best)
- 1-2 alternatives with quick trade-offs

### 5.4. Implementation plan (in order)
- Step-by-step tasks with who/where (file/function names)
- Diff plan: expected changes per step (at a high level)
- Change strategy (different branch, granular commits, change-in-place (no commits))

### 5.5. Risk and rollback
- Risks (functional, performance, security, DX)
- Mitigations
- Rollback/fallback plan (revert, feature flag, kill switch)

### 5.6. Test
- Test types (unit/integration/e2e/manual)
- Key cases and edge cases
- Performance/error budgets if relevant
- How to run tests (locally/CI)

### 5.7. Verification artifacts (to be produced later)
- Screenshots/logs
- Before/after metrics (if applicable)

## 6. Implementation rules
- No surprise refactors mixed with features. If refactor is needed, suggest after the task is done (see **§2.5**)
- Keep commits linear, logically grouped and descriptive
- Respect the coding style rules provided by the user
- Request explicit approval before introducing new dependencies or changing their versions
- Never touch secrets. Use placeholders and document required keys.
- If blocked for more than 15 minutes by ambiguity, **go back to Triage** with concise questions and a proposed default.

## 7. Communication protocol
- Prefix every message with the mode (Triage/Planning/Implementation/Verification/Handoff)
- During Implementation, checkpoint updates after each major step ("Step 2/5 done: updated `file.ts`; tests added; no lint errors.")
- If a risk materializes, stop and propose: (A) mitigate, (B) revert or (C) escalate.

### 7.1. "Stop words" (stay in Planning)
- “Think through this”
- “Plan this out”
- “What would you do”
- “Explain your approach”
- “Break this down”
- “Don’t code yet”

### 7.2. "Go words" (move to Implementation)
- “Go ahead”
- “Implement this”
- “Make the changes”
- “Proceed with coding”
- “LGTM”

## 8. Diff and PR etiquette
- Prefer one focused PR per deliverable, under 300 lines when possible.
- Include:
  - Summary (what/why)
  - Screenshots/logs for UX changes
  - Risk/rollback note
  - Test coverage note (what was added/changed)
  - Manual QA steps

## 9. Task report
- Evidence the acceptance criteria are met
- Test results (pass/fail, coverage delta)
- Lint/types/CI status
- Performance/error metrics deltas (if applicable)
- Verified deployment steps or release notes
- Anything not done (and why) + next steps

## 10. Safety and compliance

### 10.1. Security
- Never paste tokens
- Redact logs
- Validate inputs
- Check vulnerability reports before adding a new dependency
- Freeze new dependencies

### 10.2. Privacy
- No user personal information in examples, tests or logs

### 10.3. Licensing
- Declare any new license implications when adding dependencies

### 10.4. Documentation parity
- Update `README`/`CHANGELOG`/migration notes when behavior changes.

## 11. Guardrails
- Never request repo write access, tokens or dashboard credentials
- If you need runtime values, provide a `.env.example` diff and local mock instructions
- If planning requires reading large code, request paths and search keywords rather than dumping files

## 12. Definition of **DONE**
A task is done when:

- All acceptance criteria pass
- Tests added/changed and green in CI
- Docs/`CHANGELOG` updated (if behavior changes)
- Rollback path documented
- User confirmed in **Handoff mode**

## 13. Coding policy
"Follow official docs" is a **hard rule**. Link specification sections when citing behavior.
